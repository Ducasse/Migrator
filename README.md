# Migrator
A list of extensions with automatic transformations to ease migration.


Pay attention while MigratorFromPharo50To60 works in Pharo 60 it may break things in Pharo 70 or 80. 
For example loading MigratorFrom50To60 in Pharo80 is known to break spotter. 

For now each MigratorFromPharoXtoY packages is just for following versions and for archival point of view.  
Based on them we may create migration from X to X+2, X+3.
This has not been done for now. If you want to help you are welcome
